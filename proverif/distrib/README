Protocol verifier, copyright INRIA-CNRS, by Bruno Blanchet, 
Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre 2000-YEAR.

This software can be used to prove secrecy and authenticity properties
of cryptographic protocols.

INSTALL

There are three possibilities for installing ProVerif: 
either the source distribution or the binary distribution for Windows,
or install it through OPAM. 

******* Source distribution (and documentation)

To run this software, you need Objective Caml version 4.03 or
higher. Objective Caml can be downloaded from
	http://caml.inria.fr

The installation of graphviz is required if you want to have a drawing 
of graphs representing attacks that ProVerif found. It can be downloaded from
        http://graphviz.org
      
The installation GTK+2.24 and LablGTK2 is required if you want to
run the interactive simulator proverif_interact. Use the package manager
of your distribution to install GTK+2 and download lablgtk-2.18.6.tar.gz
from
	http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/
and follow the installation instructions in their README file.

Furthermore, on Mac OS X, you need to install XCode if you do not
already have it. It can be downloaded from
	https://developer.apple.com/xcode/

* under Unix

Uncompress the source and documentation archives using tar:

	gunzip proverifVERSION.tar.gz
	tar -xf proverifVERSION.tar
	gunzip proverifdocVERSION.tar.gz
	tar -xf proverifdocVERSION.tar

or if you have GNU tar:

	tar -xzf proverifVERSION.tar.gz
	tar -xzf proverifdocVERSION.tar.gz

This will create a directory named proverifVERSION in the current directory.
Go into this directory, and build the programs:

	cd proverifVERSION
	./build

* under Windows 

Uncompress the archives proverifVERSION.tar.gz and proverifdocVERSION.tar.gz
using Winzip, in the directory of your choice. This will create a
subdirectory named proverifVERSION. Open a DOS window, cd into the
proverifVERSION directory and run the build .BAT file:

	build

The system can run under Windows, but it is not very Windows-friendly:
you have to use the command line to run the programs. Improving the interface
is on the to-do list...

******* Binary distribution for Windows (and documentation)

The installation of graphviz is required if you want to have a drawing 
of graphs representing attacks that ProVerif found. It can be downloaded from
        http://graphviz.org

The installation GTK+2.24 is required if you want to run the interactive
simulator proverif_interact. At
	ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.24/
download gtk+-bundle_2.24.10-20120208_win32.zip
unzip it in the directory C:\GTK, and add C:\GTK\bin to your PATH.

* under Cygwin

Uncompress the binary and documentation archives using GNU tar:

	tar -xzf proverifbinVERSION.tar.gz
	tar -xzf proverifdocVERSION.tar.gz

This will create a directory named proverifVERSION in the current directory.

* under Windows 

Uncompress the archives proverifbinVERSION.tar.gz and 
proverifdocVERSION.tar.gz using Winzip, in the directory
of your choice. This will create a subdirectory named proverifVERSION. 

******* Installation through OPAM

OPAM can be downloaded from:
	https://opam.ocaml.org
After installing OPAM, do:
      opam install proverif
      opam depext proverif
(The second line should install graphviz if you do not already have it.
You may also choose to install graphviz manually if needed.)


USAGE

This software contains three executable programs, proverif, proveriftotex,
and proverif_interact. 

The program proverif takes as input a description of a cryptographic
protocol, and checks whether it satisfies secrecy, authenticity, or
equivalence properties. The description of the protocol can have
several different formats.  The recommended format is the typed pi
calculus format, which is a dialect of the applied pi calculus (Abadi
and Fournet, POPL'01).  The description of the protocol is first
translated into Horn clauses, then the core of the verifier is called.
This input format is documented in the file docs/manual.pdf
(found in proverifdocVERSION.tar.gz). Examples of protocol descriptions 
can be found in the examples/pitype subdirectory. 
To run these examples, use 
        ./proverif <filename>.pv
or if your filename does not end in .pv,
        ./proverif -in pitype <filename>
For example:
	./proverif examples/pitype/secr-auth/NeedhamSchroederPK.pv

Other input formats are documented in the file docs/manual-untyped.pv
Research papers can be downloaded at
	https://bblanche.gitlabpages.inria.fr/publications/index.html
They are not included in the distribution because of copyright differences.
(You cannot redistribute these papers.)

The program proveriftotex takes as input a protocol description
and converts it into a LaTeX file. This is useful for including
protocols in research papers.

The program proverif_interact is an interactive simulator for ProVerif
scripts.

The script "test" runs several tests (Unix or cygwin only):
You can run them by
         ./test 
The output of these scripts is written in the directory tests. The
filename of the output is "typed" follwed by the
date/time of the run.
